# Laptop

Laptop is a playbook to set up an OS X laptop (for web development).

It installs and configures most of the software Siyelo uses on our Macs for web and software development. 

Some things in OS X are difficult to automate (notably, the Mac App Store, and certain tools from Apple, so some manual installation steps are still required, but at least it's all documented here.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Requirements

We've tested it on;

* OS X Yosemite (~10.10.4)

## Installation

    curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siyelo/laptop/master/mac
    sh mac

Finally, there are a few other preferences and settings added on for various apps and services.

## Future additions

### Things that still need to be done manually

It's my hope that I can get the rest of these things wrapped up into Ansible playbooks soon, but for now, these steps need to be completed manually (assuming you already have Xcode and Ansible installed, and have run this playbook).

  1. Set JJG-Term as the default Terminal theme (it's installed, but not set as default automatically).
  2. Install [Sublime Package Manager](http://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
  3. Install all the Mac App Store Apps (see below).
  4. Install all the apps that aren't yet in this setup (see below).
  5. Remap Caps Lock to Escape (keycode 53), using [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en).
  6. Set trackpad tracking rate.
  7. Set mouse tracking rate.
  8. Configure extra Mail and/or Calendar accounts (e.g. Google, Exchange, etc.).

### Applications/packages to be added:

These are mostly direct download links, some are more difficult to install because of custom installers or other nonstandard install quirks:

  - [iShowU HD](http://downloads.shinywhitebox.com/iShowU_HD_Pro_2.3.7.dmg)

### Configuration to be added:

  - I have vim configuration in the repo, but I still need to add the actual installation:
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/autoload
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim > pathogen.vim
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    ```

### Apps only available via the App Store

I also use the following apps at least once or twice per week, but unfortunately, as the Mac App Store is not able to be controlled via CLI, or any other way I can find (so far), I have to manually install all of these apps from within the App Store application.

  - Tweetbot
  - RadarScope
  - Pixelmator
  - Skitch
  - Quick Resizer
  - 1Password
  - DaisyDisk
  - Byword
  - Aperture
  - Pages
  - Keynote
  - Numbers

There are a couple other apps I'm leaving out of the list, like Microsoft Word, because I normally don't install them unless/until I need them.

## Development

You shouldn't wipe your entire workstation and start from scratch just to test changes to the playbook. 

Instead, you can follow theses instructions for [how to build a Mac OS X VirtualBox VM](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-osx-virtualbox-vm), on which you can continually run and re-run this playbook to test changes and make sure things work correctly.

### Approach

We've tested it using an OSX 10.10 Vagrant/Virtualbox VM for developing & testing the Ansible scripts.

Simply spin up the Yosemite box in a VM, and have vagrant kick off the laptop setup.

### Whats included?

Nada. Well not much. The whole point is to test the process of getting our OSX dev machines from zero to hero. 

The Vagrant box we use is a [clean-ish install of OSX](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates). However the setup notes above uses Packer, which installs Xcode CLI tools. This can't be automated in an actual test run, and needs user intervention to install.


### Test Setup

1. Get [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/)
    
      brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) 

      brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" vagrant

1. Install VirtualBox;

      brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" virtualbox

1. cd into this project directory;

1. Run 

        vagrant init http://files.dryga.com/boxes/osx-yosemite-10.10.3.0.box;

1. The Vagrantfile should be ready as soon as Vagrant downloads the box;

1. Start VM 

        vagrant up

### Notes

* VirtualBox doesn't have Guest additions for Mac OS X, so you can't have shared folders. Instead you can use normal network shared folders.

* If you are rolling your own box with [the OSX VM template](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates), this is the Packer config;

      packer build \
        -var iso_checksum=aaaabbbbbbcccccccdddddddddd \
        -var iso_url=../out/OSX_InstallESD_10.10.4_14E46.dmg \
        -var update_system=0 \
        -var autologin=true \
        template.json


## TODO

* no forking install a la [battleschool](http://spencer.gibb.us/blog/2014/02/03/introducing-battleschool/).

    #if needed
    $ sudo easy_install pip

    $ sudo pip install siyelo-laptop

  - [Battleschool](http://spencer.gibb.us/blog/2014/02/03/introducing-battleschool) is a more general solution than what I've built here. (It may be a better option if you don't want to fork this repo and hack it for your own workstation...).
  - [osxc](https://github.com/osxc) is another more general solution, set up so you can fork the [xc-custom](https://github.com/osxc/xc-custom) repo and get your own local environment bootstrapped quickly.
  - [MWGriffin/ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/MWGriffin/ansible-playbooks) was the original inspiration for this repository, but this project has since been completely rewritten.
